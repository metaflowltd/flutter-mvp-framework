# Flutter MVP framework

A flutter MVP framework, written with coding practices applied in my other technology agnostic mobile development framework - jVanila.

The framework showcases how to apply MVP pattern in depth.

Check Routing / Navigation example https://github.com/pavan2you/flutter-mvp-framework/tree/master/stack. The dynamic route poping is little tricky in flutter, this solves that problem.
